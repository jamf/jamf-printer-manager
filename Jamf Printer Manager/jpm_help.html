        <h1>Jamf Printer Manager Help</h1>

        <p>Use Jamf Printer Manager to add/remove/modify printers on your Jamf Pro Server</p>
        <img src="./app.png" alt="Jamf Printer Manager">

        <p>After the app finishes launching you will get a list of locally installed printers (that are not available in Jamf Pro) on the left and a list of printers currently available for deployment on the right.</p>

       <h3>Adding printers to Jamf Pro:</h3>
       <p>Printers can be added by either:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Double clicking a printer from the list on the left.</li>
        <li>Selecting one or more printers from the list on the left and clicking the Add button.</li>
	   </ul>
        <p>Be sure to select a category for the added printer(s) to have that set in Jamf Pro, if desired.</p>

        <h3>Removing printers from Jamf Pro:</h3>
        <p>Select one or more printers to be removed from Jamf Pro, then either select the '-' button or hit the delete key on the keyboard.
            You will be presented with a confirmation dialog to verify the removal:</p>
        <img src="./removePrinter.png" alt="Remove">
        <p>
            <div style='vertical-align:middle; display:inline;'>
                Note, the local printers available list (left table) does not automatically update as printers are removed from Jamf Pro.  If you remove a printer from Jamf Pro and would like it listed again in the list of printers that can be added, click the refresh button:
            </div>
            <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src='./refresh.png' alt="Refresh">
        <br>
        The printer must be installed locally to reappear in the list.</p>

        <h3>Modifying a printer in Jamf Pro:</h3>
       <p>Printer properites can be modified for printers currently available in Jamf Pro.
        Double click a printer from the list on the right.  You will be presented with a new window that allows modifications:</p>
        <img src="./modify.png" alt="Modify">
        <p>Note, there are 3 different tabs available for modifying the printer properties; General, Definition, and Limitations, similar to what is available in Jamf Pro.</p>
        
        <p>The category for one or more existing printers can be changed by selecting the printer(s) then right-clicking.</p>
        <img src="./massAction.png" alt="change category">
    
        <p>To manage printers on another server click the 'Change Server' button located in the top right corner of the mail window.  Either select an existing printer or add a new one.</p>
        <p>If you find a server listed in the login window that you would like to remove select it while holding down the option key.</p>
